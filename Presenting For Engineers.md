# Presenting for Engineers
[TOC]

Hi, I'm Alex. I'm a ~~robotics senior~~ nano-electronics masters wannabe in SUTD, and I love presenting. I present for projects, emcee for the school, and represent the community for speeches. 

But being an engineer, people seem to have the impression that engineers can't present, speak or share their ideas. I'd take offence, but offence is pretty darn useless. So I'm writing this: a guide to aggressively level up an engineer and turn them into a decent presenter. Hell, if this unlocks some hidden potential within someone and they become *Steve Jobs Two: Electric Bogaloo*, then all the more power to them.

Based off of a lighting talk I delivered as part of SUTD Unfiltered called _How to Unf*ck Your Presentations_.

Hi there. This is a work in progress. I'd appreciate comments and ideas, so please feel free to  leave a comment or to message me - if you have this link, you probably have some way of contacting me. If you're a fellow SUTDent, you can look for me on the school email system. 

My plan for this is:
1. Release into the school community, probably hosted on one of OpenSUTD's platforms, for juniors to use.
2. Offer reviews and guidance on presentation for anyone interested.
3. Develop this into a workshop that I can host for the school community, possibly as part of IAP.

## Common Complaints 

Engineers can't present, they say.

If we are to address an undesirable reputation, we must first find the chief complaints of it. What is it that engineers lack that, say, business students have? Do you see yourself in these descriptions?

I've compiled these points from personal experiences and a quick survey of my friends - by no means are these issues exhaustive. 

1. **Disengaged** - presentations are delivered dryer than the Sahara. Seems to not care for the audience nor the topic, either.
2. **Jargon salad** - emphasis on technical details rather than explaining the key principles first.
3. **Unpracticed** - unsure of content, unsure of what's next. 
    - Related: Fillers such as "um...", "ya you know...", "like...". Being unpracticed also manifests as rambling about a point - that's because you're coming up with content on the fly and spewing whatever seems relevant. Some people can (m)ad-lib, yes, but ad-libs are a _last resort._
5. **Reading, not Presenting** - reading off slides because they don't know what they have to say. Related to *Unpracticed*. 


At first glance, many of these are very typical faults in presentations - nothing very specific to engineers - except for that some of these faults are especially heinious because of the technical nature of our work. It is already work that is hard to understand and contextualize - don't make it any harder for your audience by presenting poorly.

### Technically Speaking...
We use jargon to sound like we know when we don't.

**The most convincing arguments don't come laden with heaps of jargon.** They might be long, yes, but not particularly jargon-filled. Persuasion and understanding come from simplicity - that's why the Feynman technique and ELI5 work. We fail to deliver the proper level of technicality in our presentations - elaborating on finite element analysis results to a layman does nothing for the listener, and drowning your professor with gritty details before explaining the broader ideas just frustrates them. 

Jargon salad, for one, stands out. 

It is entirely too easy to lapse into technical precision at the price of clarity, especially given the technical nature of our work, as it is often filled with jargon and definitions.
I repeat - we neglect *clarity* for *precision*.  Dousing our presentations with jargon also alienates those who are unfamiliar with these terms. The hyper-specialised nature of modern engineering (and the sciences, as well) mean that jargon from subjects which are even a **little bit adjacent** are indecipherable to people who aren't in the field - a Robotics engineer would confuse a mechanical one with all his talk about sensor fusion and automation. 


### wow so much passion 
Another failing we have **is appearing disengaged**. While it does not affect the content of the presentation, it does, however, affect the audience experience. In this case, form is also part of function. Without audience engagement, you relinquish your hold on their attention, and your content is lost upon them.

Even though we've burnt the midnight oil several times over, and we've sunk hours upon hours into the project, somehow we instantly lose all passion for the project the moment we present it. Perhaps it's dry delivery, or simply not caring to know about the project, **a dispassionate presentation will kill audience interest almost instantly.**

### 1 Star Delivery

This is a generic issue, not specific to engineering. However, because of the nature of our field, esoteric and dry as it is, the stakes for proper delivery are ever higher. **I get it, engineering is dry and hard to understand. That's precisely why we must deliver our content well.** 

When we speak to our slides instead of the audience, or release their attentions with awkward pauses and filler words, the audience *is lost*. The moment we let go of them, they're washed away into the wide ocean of `difficult engineering things`. 

Don't lose em. You'll have to paddle really hard to get them back.

## The Endgame

So now we've seen the state we're in - but we don't have to stay that way. What is it that we aspire to? Imagine yourself as the ultimate presenter. What do you see in your presentation? What style do you embody? What does your audience remember at the end? 

Sike, y'all. The only question that matters is the last part. When you present, your endgame is delivering some sort of value to the audience. The form of this value will differ - context is king here. Let say you've developed some new product as part your project:

|Who|Value|
|---|---|
|General public|What good does the product do for me? |
|Professors|How have you applied the skills and knowledge from class to this? What self-learning have you done for this project? What are the engineering principles behind this?|
|Classmates|Am I going to be entertained? How is this project a novel application of our learned knowledge - and how is that going to inspire me?|
|YOU|How can I best show the results of my 6 all-nights, 15 orders of Enak Enak and panda eyebags worth of effort? |


These are some forms that value can take with your project.  Remember: it's what your *audience receives* that matters, which brings me to my next point.

### Attention? Priceless...
No matter how amazing your project is, and no matter how comprehensive your presentation is, **the moment your audience stops paying attention, nothing is going to get through.** In this case, form is inseparable from function. The onus is sadly on you do deliver your presentation in a palatable form.

When you're in front of the audience, you become the most powerful person in the room. Whatever you say or do is going to either inspire the shit out of your audience, or bore them to the Nine Hells. With that kind of power, you'd best have some responsibility. Good thing - we can talk about that.

### And for everything else, there's Mastercard
The good thing is that every other failing can be remedied with practice and confidence - which happen to feed into each other. The more you practice, the more confident you will be, and the more confidence you have, the better your practices.

## The Remedy
### The Ability to Present
"But I can't present, Alex!", I hear you cry. That's patently false. 

If you've ever ranted to someone, or tried to argue with someone, or so fanboy over something to someone, you can present. The ability to deliver your beliefs and ideas passionately is the cornerstone of presenting. **As long as you give a damn about the subject you're talking about, then you can present.** It might take some hours to sort out the details and to get the practice in, but that's the price of competence.

What's a study guide without some exercise for practice. Here's one:

#### Sudden Mission: Rubber Ducky, You're the One

I want you to rant about something you're passionate about for 2 minutes. You can find a partner to do this with you, or you can just use a rubber duck and rant to it. What matters is that you direct your energies towards someone or something.

You don't have to start in any particular way. Set a timer for two minutes, and just start with "I want to talk about =thing=" 

It's usually easier if it's something that irks you. Here are some ideas that would get me riled up:
1. Underappreciated food
2. Things that admin staff do that bother you
3. Bad teammates
4. Wasted potential of certain projects
5. For my fellow NSmen, National Service! For the everyone else, about the exclusionary nature of conversations when the Singaporean guys start talking about NS.

When you're done, open the spoiler:

You're probably rather excited right now, so take a moment to breathe and reset yourself.

Done? Good. Did you make it to two minutes? Did you find it hard to stop? If you're lucky, you'll find that at some point, the words just keep flowing. That's the sweet spot you want to tap into when you present. 

If you can rant, you can present. And you've just ranted. See you outside.

### Giving That One Critical Damn
The surest path to failure in a presentation is not caring about it. Even if you have no skills whatsover, effort alone can guarantee a middling presentation - and at least, we can learn and improve skills.

Good news - if you're reading this, you probably care about your presentation. Since we're engineers, let's talk about [practical things](https://youtu.be/SNgNBsCI4EA?t=21). **The major constraint against investing effort into a presentation is that a presentation typically takes place when it's rush hour: the end of some work cycle (term/half-term/project).** If you're desperately rushing your project, how can you spend time on something like a presentation? 

1. Tedium like **presentation design and the like can be decided very far in advance.** When you get your problem statement or decide your project direction, you can look up relevant [presentation templates](https://www.slidescarnival.com/category/free-templates) or your create [your own template](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-and-save-a-powerpoint-template-ee4429ad-2a74-4100-82f7-50f8169c8aca). For my Capstone, I based the colour scheme and design off of the company's colour scheme. Of course, corporate colours usually suck for slides and posters, so I took some liberties on the saturation and such.
2. Collecting points on the fly. Over the course of your project, **slap key points and ideas into your slides.** They should not be clean and pretty, but rather form a draft of how your presentation should flow. Hell, straight up lift key ideas and phrases from your sources. This helps you skip the "How should the presentation flow?" phase, which is frankly a waste of time. Include your sources as well so you don't end up frantically searching for that one elusive paper on some Russian website.
3. Ultimately, like all projects, don't leave it till the end. The goal here is to suffer early so you don't have to chiong and produce substandard work at the end. 
#### Sudden Mission: Meta-templating
If you're very free (maybe your DOTA is updating, or the MapleSEA servers are down for some reason), you can be a bit meta and create your own meta-template for presentations. For any presentation, there are always a few things you'll need, such as fonts, layouts and flows. Why not pick out your preferred fonts and layouts beforehand, and use them again and again for all your projects? 

Go pick 2 font pairings (eg: Header/Content pairs) and 1 open-source slide template you like, then store them in a secret folder that you'll open when you start prepping slides. If you need inspiration, you can open the spoiler below.

### Explain It Like I'm 5
You've probably heard about the Feynman technique (if you haven't, look at [this Farnam Street article](https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/), and it's especially important in this case because: 1) you're explaining a topic to someone else who may not have your technical background 2) you need to show you understand your project, and being able to explain it simply is proof of that.

The wonderful thing about simplicity is that it also helps you stay concise. I find that repeatedly simplifying a topic (while retaining its essence) helps me do away with unnecessary information. If you suspect your audience will ask about it, consider slapping all these things into an appendix. That way, you can save time in your presentation, and you can surprise them with a "I knew you were gonna ask this hoho behold my 50 page appendix".

This won't be very difficult if you understand the topic. 

#### Sudden Mission: ELI5
Pick any technical topic that you know about, and explain it to a partner/rubber duck in any way you want.  

Did you find yourself lapsing into jargon? Or borrowing from other concepts? Now try again, but make a conscious effort to simplify it. If you can't find the words and need to reference some other concept, that's fine.

Now one more time, but simplify your borrowed concepts as well! If you can construct a full explanation without borrowing something, then you probably understand it pretty well.

People enjoy being stupid. Pander to their preference for cognitive ease. Explain it like they're five.

### Practicing.
Practice does not make perfect - *perfect* practice makes perfect. And it has to be *your* perfect practice. 

I'll share my own methods below, but your mileage may vary. I usually use **spaced repetition** and having **anchor points** instead of scripts.

1. Have the main points of the presentation written down. 
2. Try one run within the allocated timing. Expect to fail terribly. Record and review if you need to.
3. Compare the relative importance of each point covered. Is it commensurate to the time allocated? At this juncture, certain **hooks** should start appearing - maybe some flamboyant turn of phrase, or a certain statistic or cadence that seems catchy? Tether these to actions. If you need to record down these key phrases, do so. But don't script large sections.
4. Chill for a bit, regain your bearings. Try again. Repeat at most 5 times, but usually less. If there are any problematic parts, spend a bit more time on them. You can skip easier parts like intros.
5. Carry on with life, while doing these run-reduce-record cycles about once a day. If you're rushing for time, do it once every few hours.
6. When it's time to do some major practice, repeat and repeat and repeat till satisfied.

As you can see, I tend to favour spreading out the practices instead of forcing a long session. I find that it helps me consolidate my points better (something about the brain churning in the background), and makes delivery smoother.

Other things you can do:
1. Flash cards and the like.
2. Recording the whole thing and watching it. It's cringy, but it also forces you to come to terms with the quality of your presentation.
3. Script - you can do it at first to build confidence, and eventually do away with it. Or transition to notes and flash cards.
4. Props? If they help you explain? They can help sidestep lengthy explanations, but you'll have to invest time into making this. 

## The Checklist
    
1. Do you care about the subject?
2. Does the presentation cater to the audience?
3. Did you take out the jargon?
4. Did you practise?

# The Appendix

## Egregious Engineering Errors in Presenting

Collected from an Instagram survey of my friends, many of which are engineers.

1. Reading off the slides or conversely going off tangent from what the slides show
2. Drowning in technical detail. Forgetting our target audience and not catering to them
3. Not sounding coherent
4. Singlish. Too many people still use Singlish without realising it.
5. Fumbling when talking about your plan... take a deep breath and pause instead.
6. Too used to filler words in conversation, like, you know.
7. "erm..." as fillers.
8. Occasional public speaking mistakes like projection, tone, direction, eye contact, pauses. etc
9. Mismatch of level of technicality to the target audience (ie. presenting to tech people or layman)
10. Presenting something they clearly had no part in / no understanding of / no confidence in.
